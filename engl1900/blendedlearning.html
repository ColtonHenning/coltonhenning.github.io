    <p class="text-justify">Some studies have found that the face to face learning time is very important for students to be able to pass online classes. In the video the TED Talk speaker explains her experience with a rotational learning model for online blended programs in education.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">She points to learning programs for reading and math and teaching videos, such as Khan academy, that many people use even when not in a school with these programs. She says these programs help students become independent learners and to have each student's coursework individualized to them. This creates a more well rounded student who can focus specifically on what they need to work on.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">However she say school districts must keep in mind blended learning programs and computers are only a tool they can’t supplement good teaching with computers. Computers and technology only are a piece of the model, this model must include teachers, students,and collaborative work as well.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">There are some limitations that she points to toward the end of her talk. The speaker emphasizes that in order to have program work a school district must have flexibility, commitment, a forward thinking mindset, and teachers that will still have an impact on students.</p>

    <h3>There are six main types of blended learning models:</h3>
    <div>
      <ol>
        <li>Face-to-face model</li>
          <ol>
            <li type="a">Mainly normal in class learning</li>
            <li type="a">Online learning case-by-case for the students who need it and used to supplement normal learning</li>
          </ol>
        <li>Rotational</li>
          <ol>
            <li type="a">Students work online by themselves</li>
            <li type="a">At school students can work in collaborative groups</li>
            <li type="a">Work face to face with a teacher if they need more help</li>
          </ol>
        <li>Lab Setting</li>
          <ol>
            <li type="a">Go to computer lab about once a day or a few times a week to work on an assignment with teacher there to help</li>
          </ol>
        <li>Open/Flex Model</li>
          <ol>
            <li type="a">Primary online learning with supplemental assistance during the school day in person</li>
          </ol>
        <li>Flipped Model</li>
          <ol>
            <li type="a">Students do the learning at home by watching videos</li>
            <li type="a">Then does homework at school in class with the teacher there to help with questions</li>
          </ol>
        <li>Self-blended Programs</li>
          <ol>
            <li type="a">Students can structure their learning and school day to what fits them best</li>
          </ol>
        </ol>

    <h3>Assistive Technology</h3>
    <img src="images/assistivetech.jpg" class="img-fluid pb-3" alt="Assistive Technology">
    <p class="text-justify">Assistive learning and assistive technology are a sector of educational and life technology with the purpose of helping those with disabilities. However, assistive learning technologies usually are so helpful that people without disabilities benefit from them as well.</p>
    
    <div class="row pb-3 pt-4 pl-3 pr-3">
      <h3>Other Uses of AT</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Texting</li>
        <li>Hearing Aids</li>
        <li>Audiobooks</li>
        <li>Spell Check</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-justify">Need based learning programs are also used for kids who don’t necessarily have learning disabilities, but are behind in school work. Some of these programs do have issues in the sense they are only increasing the use of technology for the kids who are behind which seems unfair to the rest of the children.</p>
      <p class="text-justify">One of the main reasons for the positive effects of using them have to do with the personalization it allows each student to have in their learning. By utilizing individualized learning implemented through technology each child is able to move at their own pace and learn in the best way for them. “... the instructor can settle on the best way to present context to special ed students through the flipped [assistive technology] model,” (Schaffhauser 2013).</p>
      <p class="text-justify">One of these concerns is that kids with disabilities might become too reliant on these forms of technology. Those that can work in the future could have a difficult time transitioning to not having this resource for them to fall back on if there is an issue. However, this is true for all children when talking about increasing technology in the classroom setting, they may become too reliant.</p>
