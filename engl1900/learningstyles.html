    <h1>Changes in Learning Styles</h1>
    <p class="text-justify">In the last couple of decades, the use of information technology in classrooms has become more prevalent that ever. There are new and exciting methods of teaching that have never been possible before such as flipped classroom, where the lecture is taught at home and homework is done during class, or online learning, where students do not have to come to a traditional classroom setting. With these changes however, there are concerns with how teachers adapt to the integration of technology and how students react to the changes in learning that they must overcome.</p>

    <h4>Flipped Classroom</h4>
</div>  

<div class="row">
    <ol>
        <li>Delivers material outside the classroom online</li>
        <li>More time is devoted to homework during regular class time instead</li>
        <li>Must utilize new or existing technology - dependent on the school</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div class="row pb-1 pt-1 pl-3 pr-3">
    <p class="text-justify">Flipped classroom mainly consists of assigning interactive quizzes and online collaborative projects at home. The videos and lectures are watched at home instead allowing class time for hand-on projects, homework, and general help. This allows the majority of the curriculum to reside online. Students gain one-on-one time with each other or the teacher. There is also the benefit of working in groups to tackle problems and work instead of individually.</p>

<div class="row pb-1 pt-1 pl-3 pr-3">
    <h4>Online Learning</h4>
</div>  

<div class="row">
    <ol>
        <li>Online degrees or course are offered by almost all major universities</li>
        <li>University of Phoenix the biggest (~321,000) students </li>
        <li>Classes can be taken the leisure of the student</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div class="row pb-1 pt-1 pl-3 pr-3">
    <p class="text-justify">Online teaching provides instructors with greater flexibility to address varying styles of learning using different types of technologies. Online classes may actually increase participation from students who normally don’t actively participate in traditional classroom settings. The instructors also gain the benefit of having the wealth of technology available to them to make classrooms more engaging and interesting. Teachers will also enjoy the freedom and flexibility in teaching from home. Although teacher-student interaction is heavily reduced, teachers can meet with students at more convenient times.</p>

    <h4>What Students are Saying</h4>
</div>  

<div class="row">
    <ol>
        <li>Students can interact with the technology at their own pace and review material when necessary to aid understanding or memory.</li>
        <li>Computer-based tools help students develop their visual, kinesthetic, aural, and oral skills.</li>
        <li>Students with physical disabilities can use computers with adaptive devices so that they can participate fully with their classmates.</li>
        <li>Computers help students transform data from numbers to graphs or translate words from one language to another.</li>
