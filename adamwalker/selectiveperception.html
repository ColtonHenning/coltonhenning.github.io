    <h3><b>Selective Perception</b></h3>
    <p class="text-justify">Selective Perception is the practice that has become common on social media of individuals aligning their social media feed with their political and ideological beliefs. However, there are disadvantages to this practice, and as with all things, it should be done in moderation. One of the main issues seen with selective perception in social media is that it creates a polarized political spectrum where left and right ideas are split into two corners. In a study focused on selective exposure to news and political news consumption, many researchers have pointed out that due to the increasing number of online news sources has led to “a greater polarization” caused by people who have the ability to “choose exclusively like minded sources” (Masip, Suau-Martínez, Ruiz-Caballero 303). These exclusively like-minded sources create something commonly referred to as echo chambers. This phenomenon is a dangerous habit of social media users that causes them to become increasingly entrenched in their own political beliefs every time they log onto their account. 
    <h2><b>Echo Chamber</b></h2>
    <p class = "text-justify">Echo chambers have been created on social media as a result of selective perception. People are constantly bombarded with ideals that align with their own. This phenomenon increases the chance of people becoming more entrenched in their own beliefs. When people are constantly bombarded with similar information from similar people, it is easy to look past small inaccuracies in articles and posts in order to agree with what is being said. Echo chambers have no place on social media, and it is important for individuals to have a variety of sources and information on their feed.
