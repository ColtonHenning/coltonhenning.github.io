    <h3><b>Fake News</b></h3>
    <p class="text-justify">The manipulation caused by fake news is inherently wrong, and measures are being taken to stop it, but have not proven effective yet. While it is easy to argue over the exact definition of fake news, one thing is objectively true: it increases ignorance in the American public and is a severe harm to social media and those who use it. The negative aspects of fake news are endless, and the amount of fake news circulating seems infinite. This outright false information that spreads around social media is a term coined popular by our nation’s President. An unfortunate circumstance that has continued to occur is the misuse of the term “fake news”. News networks and political figures in our country who oppose each other misuse this term all the time, using it to protect themselves from a negative public image. The 2016 Presidential Election is perhaps the worst outcome of fake news circulating on social media because there is no real way to determine the entire effect. This terrible outcome is not the fact that Donald Trump won the presidency, but the thought that voters could be influenced by something completely imaginary over a platform that is supposed to increase knowledge in the American public. During the campaigning, “fabricated stories favoring Donald Trump were shared a total of 30 million times, nearly quadruple the number of pro-Hillary Clinton shares leading up to the election…” (Crawford). The point of this statistic is not to condemn Donald Trump for having more fake news shared about him, but rather to display the troubling trend in America that people use whatever news necessary to support their narrative, and often do not fact-check beforehand. While Generation Z and Millenials are the most frequent users of social media, they are not the most common to fall for falsified information on the internet. 

  The generation known as Baby Boomers are the most susceptible to fall for fake news articles. It can be seen on Facebook when those of an older generation frequently post or comment on articles that align with their political belief. While this might seem like something of small importance, there are serious ramifications to these actions. According to a recent Gallup Poll, there is a +23 percent gap between conservatives and liberals in the Baby Boomer generation. Combining these two pieces of information, it is easy to see why Donald Trump had more fabricated stories shared about him in the lead up to the 2016 election. During the campaign many middle-class Republicans were on the fence about who to vote for, finding it difficult to find a balance between some of the more radical ideals of Trump, and the loyalty to the Republican party. A small town in Macedonia experienced a large influx of cash with the outcome being “a small group of young people [who] published more than a hundred pro-Trump websites with hundreds of thousands of Facebook followers.” (Heer). One of these articles that was particularly believed to influence Republicans was one that linked the Pope to an endorsement of Trump, which never happened. Small articles like these guided “on the fence voters” towards a vote for Donald Trump. While the true effect will never be known of how these fake news articles affected the specific numbers of the election, there was an effect due to the number of shares and the spotlight that came with these articles. The polarization of American politics will continue with these unfortunate, yet constant sharing of articles of fake news.
