    <h3><b>About Us</b></h3>
    <p class="text-justify"><b>We are a group of college students from St. Louis, MO devoted to providing students and our peers with access to safe information that has not been affected by political bias. </b></p>
    <h3> <b> Personal Beliefs </b> </h3>
    
    <p class = "text-justify"> <b>Kevin Bacani: My name is Kevin Bacani and I am a freshman here at Saint Louis University in the flight science program of Parks College. I was drawn towards delving into the polarization of news and politics because I believe it is something that has great implications on American society without a lot of people realizing so. I hope to shed light on the issue and help inform someone on how this is affecting us, to what degree, and how to be a smarter user of social media and consumer of news/politics.</b> </p>
    <p class = "text-justify"> <b> Logan Capps: I am a freshman studying Biomedical Engineering at Saint Louis University. Polarization in online news has really affected many relationships I have with other people including friends and family. It is difficult to have a comfortable discourse with people I know who are heavily involved in using online social media as a new source. My goal within Polarization Police is to create a better informed individual who has knowledge to understand both perspectives during political discussion. </b> </p>
    <p class = "text-justify"> <b> Adam Walker: I am a freshman studying Aerospace Engineering at Saint Louis University. I believe that the polarization of the American public is mainly due to the use of social media to spread political news and ideals. I have seen debates on social media where people only become further entrenched in their ideals due to the use of biased and harmful language. </b> </p>
